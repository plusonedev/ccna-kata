# The CCNA Kata

Practice makes perfect but finding time to practice can be difficult.  This repo is a collection of common setup tasks for Cisco routers and switches.  The idea is to be able to sit down and run through this kata as fast as possible in as little time as possible, making all of these tasks second nature.

This is a work-in-progress and I am always open to suggestions and pull-requests.

## Setup
The absolutely awesome underlying framework is [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).  I couldn't recommend it more for anyone that dreads having to make powerpoints for their day-job.  The yeoman generator ([generator-reveal](https://github.com/slara/generator-reveal)) makes adding slides a one-line operation.  The information in those repose should be enough to get you going.  I'll add more detailed "get going" instructions at a later date.
